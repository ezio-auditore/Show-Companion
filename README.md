# Show-Companion
A small MEAN stack project for gettting TV shows info from TVdb Api and implemeting subscribe for particular logged in shows where users will
get emails 2 hours before the show is aired.
The TV show posters are saved in Amazon S3 Buckets which I am using as CDN.
Has local authentication and agenda(https://github.com/rschmukler/agenda) for scheduling mail jobs.
Using Nodemailer(https://nodemailer.com/about/) with Mailgun(https://www.mailgun.com/) for sending mails.
